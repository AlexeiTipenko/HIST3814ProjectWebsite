# Insights and Visualizations

After I ended up with a clean csv file containing all the various events and their corresponding dates, I began to create various visualizations to understand what all the data means.

The first aspect of the data I turned to was the dates. I used RStudio, along with the ggplot2, scales and lubridate packages to create a bar chart and a histogram for both the documented dates and the event dates.

Here are the two graphs for the event dates:
