<p>The cleaning process for the project was a combination of manual editing and the "Find and Replace" option found in most text editors. I personally decided to use atom as my text editor. The find and replace functionality within atom is quite powerful and it has regular expression functionality build in as well.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the cleaning process, there were certain issues that could not be fixed using any tool. For example, there was no way for a tool to recognize when an event spanned multiple lines. I also needed to add the documented dates to every single line to ensure consistency. I couldn't find a regular expression that could help me perform these two tasks.</p>
<p>Once there was a general consistency in the text file with every line consisting of 2 dates and an event, I began to actively use regex to do the rest of the cleaning.</p>
<p>A common way of using regex is to use sed commands. Here is an example.</p>
<pre><code>sed -r -i.bak 's/(,)( [0-9]{4})(.+)/\2/g' index.txt
</code></pre>
<p>This is definitely a valid method, but I found that using the find and replace option inside atom was both easier and more intuitive. All I had to do was enter my regex command into the find window and enter another command to select the groups I want to keep for the replacement in the replace window. Every time I performed a regex operation, I could clearly see if the operation was successful. If it wasn't, I would simply undo the past command.</p>
<p>Here is a list of all the commands I used to clean my text file:</p>
<pre><code>1)  ([a-zA-Z][\.][a-zA-Z][\.])([\040])(\w+)
2)  ([\040])([a-zA-Z])([\.])([\040])(\w+)
3)  ([\040])(\bC\.A\.M\.C\.)(Depot)
4)  (\b\d[/]\d\d[/]\d\d)
5)  (\d\d[/]\d\d[/])(\d\d)
6)  (\d\d[/]\d[/])(\d\d)
7)  ([^\d])(\d[/]\d[/])(\d\d)
8)  (,)(\d\d[/]\d\d[/])(\d\d\d\d)(\.)
9)  (,)(\d\d[/]\d[/])(\d\d\d\d)(\.)
10) ([\040])([a-zA-Z][\.][a-zA-Z][\.][a-zA-Z][\.][^\s\.]+)([\040])
11) ([\040])([a-zA-Z][\.][a-zA-Z][\.][^\s\.]+)([\040])
12) ([\040])([a-zA-Z][\.][^\s\.]+)([\040])
</code></pre>
<p>Most of these regular expressions do very similar things. The idea was to create a series of groups that equate to the exact format of the text I wanted to change and then simply replace them with the groups necessary.</p>
<p>For example, I wanted to find all instances of 'X.X. WORD'. This exact format is almost always mapped to a name, with some exceptions. My goal was to remove the space between the last period and the name for each instance of this pattern. So I created this regular expression:</p>
<pre><code>([a-zA-Z][.][a-zA-Z][.])([\040])(\w+)
</code></pre>
<p>All it says is to find a group that has a letter (1), period (1), letter (2), period (2), then have another group following that represents a space, and then a final group that represents a whole word of any length. After specifying this group, all I had to do was replace the 3 groups with the first and the third.</p>
<pre><code>$1$2
</code></pre>
<p>After executing this find and replace operation, the letters, periods and one word will stay, but the space in between would be deleted. This is exactly what I wanted and I didn't have to manually search through the whole text file to make all these changes. The rest of the regular expressions worked in an almost identical way.</p>
<p>Sometimes, even regex wasn't necessary. There were many words and sentences that I could find and replace with another version of them. For example '.SEAFORD' could be replaced with '. Seaford', or 'Hsp' could be replaced with "Hospital".</p>
<p>The final cleaning process involved using open refine and trifacta to merge certain words and phrases. Open refine did not work when I tried processing the entirety of the event data. There was simply too much data. I was able to make some small changes using the key collision method, however everything froze for the nearest neighbor method. To get more use out of open refine, I extracted all the names mentioned in the overall text file and did separate cleaning on it. This file was much smaller, and I was able to merge several names together. Trifacta is a software application that also allowed me to tweak a few things in my overall csv file. I was able to rename a few sentences that were almost identical to others to create a more accurate distribution of common phrases.</p>
<p>The end result was <a href="https://github.com/AlexeiTipenko/HIST3814O_Project_Repo/blob/master/cleaning/6-HOSP_14_main">this file</a>. There is no way to get a completely clean file without doing everything by hand, but I would say that the great majority of the data has been transcribed and cleaned properly. </p>
